# Instanews
 I am going to create a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via the New York Times API.
  * Fetch data from the Top Stories v2 NYT API endpoint.
  * Only display a maximum of 12 stories in the grid and only display a     story if it has a photo associated with it.
  * Transition users between UI states, beginning where no stories have been returned, and then subsequently appending stories to populate the grid (incorporate a loader GIF)

## Setup
 * Vs code

## technologies used

* css
* javascript
* jquery
  * ajax
